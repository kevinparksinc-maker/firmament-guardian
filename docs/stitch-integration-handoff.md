# Consolidated Stitch Integration Handoffs

These sections preserve the original branch handoff specifications. The branches provide implementation guidance; they do not themselves contain installed Stitch UI code.

## Home Dashboard (`feature/stitch-home-dashboard`)

### Stitch integration handoff: Home dashboard + desktop observatory

#### Source
Use the user-provided archive `stitch_the_absolute_astrology_redesign.zip` (attached in the ChatGPT conversation). This branch contains a handoff specification, **not** the exported HTML or installed UI. Do not infer that a design is implemented.

Stitch source files:
- `stitch_the_absolute_astrology_redesign/home_dashboard_the_absolute/code.html`
- `stitch_the_absolute_astrology_redesign/home_observatory_desktop_the_absolute_1/code.html`
- `stitch_the_absolute_astrology_redesign/home_observatory_desktop_the_absolute_2/code.html`

#### React integration targets
- `client/src/components/ProfileHomeScreen.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/Home.tsx`
- `client/src/components/CelestialCommandShell.css`

#### Implementation contract
- Adapt HTML/Tailwind layouts into existing React components; retain props, hooks, routes, event handlers, state, backend API calls, profile context, and loading/error states.
- Do not modify `server/`, astronomy/ephemeris modules, calculation engines, scoring formulas, or API contracts.
- Use real bound chart and energy values, not Stitch sample numbers, fake user data, or placeholder calculations.
- Preserve loaded-profile gating, Harmonic Flow Clock live values, chart data, saved profiles, navigation, and God/Agent displays. Treat Stitch static data as placeholders.
- Keep responsive mobile and desktop layouts, readable text, keyboard focus, semantic labels, and accessible contrast.
- Scope changes to this branch's target and shared UI components; coordinate shared styles with the shared-design-system branch to avoid conflicting edits.

#### Acceptance checklist
- Existing app routes and navigation still work.
- No astrology logic, engine files, or API signatures changed.
- No static Stitch example scores or birth details appear as live user data.
- Mobile and desktop screenshots visually match intended Stitch layout.
- `pnpm check`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` pass (or failures documented).
- Open a PR to `main` for review; **do not auto-merge or deploy** until approved.
